Role required advanced troubleshooting of the software as well as the servers that it ran on.  Servers were both Windows and Linux and required management of the services and resources.

Software Support - Bigcommerce
May 2014 - December 2014
I would assist clients and potential clients with issues they may have on the Bigcommerce platform or help them get to where they need in the platform.  This often consisted of providing detailed walkthroughs of setting up products, emails, product options and DNS.  There was procedural troubleshooting involved with ensuring that a client may be facing a known issue or helping discover new ones.  Basic markup (HTML & CSS) and scripting (JS)  took  place at times to assist customers with some basic changes to their themes.
